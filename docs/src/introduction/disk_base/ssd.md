# SSD

A typical SSD is built of memory cells, connected into strings (typically 32 to 64 cells per string), strings are combined into arrays, arrays are combined into pages, and pages are
combined into blocks.

Depending on the exact technology used, a cell can hold
one or multiple bits of data. 

Pages vary in size between devices, but typically their sizes range from 2 to 16 Kb. Blocks typically contain 64 to 512 pages.

Blocks are organized into planes and, finally, planes are placed on a die. SSDs
can have one or more dies.
