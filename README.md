#  Motivation

Assalamu alaikum , 

Hi there! 

My name is Nur Mohammed,  21 years old, computer enthusiast. Who is currently trying to get a job (software related)

But this is not easy, I live in a dark society, where majority of people believe that, "You wouldn't get any jobs, without degree",  Where me, who left college 3+ years ago! Now I am  suffering from impostor syndrome (Bot because I left college, I still think this is the best  decision, As I got more time explore, to learn new things!).

So as like everyone else, I start googling, found some success stories, where people got good paying job without a degree (CSE or any kind of..), All stories has a common:  "Build something unique and show that to your recruiter"

I even found some jobs, where recruiters said: "We aren't interested in your degree!" ðŸ˜Š

Unfortunately, I had many cool unsaved projects, So I have nothing to show them. 
So! now I will make some projects,  just to get a interview. 

As for now, Currently working on a database project... 

That's it, And of course you can contact me, any time you want...
