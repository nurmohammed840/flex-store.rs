This library provides a data view for reading and writing data in a byte array.

This library requires [feature(generic_const_exprs)](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2021/09/06/Splitting-const-generics.html) to be enabled. whice is a nightly feature.

So you need nightly compiler to use this library.

It also works with [no_std] environment.
